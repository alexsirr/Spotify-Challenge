# Spotify-Challenge

What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
	This site was created for people like me who like a specific style of music, but have trouble finding new music to listen to. It will take in a favorite artist and return a playlist of similar songs from similar artists.

What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
	http://students.washington.edu/sirra/info343/Spotify-Challenge/#

Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
	Thanks to Andrew for answering some questions I had!

Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
	~7 work hours. ~9 including research (spotify api and firebase research)

Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
	Some of my angular elements such as in my user sign warning about invalid email would not show up despite me doing it exactly like examples so maybe some angular troubleshooting examples would be nice.
